# OperatingSystem

- a1 -> a C program using low-level system calls (open, read, write), directory operations, and binary file parsing to process custom SF file format
- a2 -> a C program using POSIX threads (pthreads), process creation (fork), and Linux synchronization mechanisms (semaphores, mutexes, condition variables)
- a3 -> a C program using named pipes (FIFO), shared memory (POSIX shm), memory-mapped files (mmap), and low-level system calls (open, read, write)

    - C (low-level system calls)
    - Linux
    - GCC (compiler)
    - Python (for testing)
    - Docker (for evaluation)
